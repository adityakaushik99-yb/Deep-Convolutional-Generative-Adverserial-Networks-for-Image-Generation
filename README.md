# Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adverserial-Networks-for-Image-Generation
This repository is an implementation of DCGANs which are used for Image Generation.

Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Networks use Convolutional Neural Networks for as their Generator and Discriminator Networks. Instead of the max pooling and fully connected layers we use a convolutional layer in DCGAN.

The Architecture of a DCGAN is as follows:

The results of the repository can be seen in the Test_Model.ipynb file which was trained on a Google colab GPU. The results will be better with a larger number of epochs than the value chosen here.
